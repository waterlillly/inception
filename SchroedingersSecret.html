	<p style="text-align: center; font-size: medium;">Welcome to the experimental playground where containers, code, and curiosity collide. Here, we collect "personal data" (mostly for fun and learning), but like Schrödinger's cat, you can never be 100% sure what's happening until you peek. Comments, cookies, and mysterious log files may exist in a state of superposition — sometimes recorded, sometimes not. Honestly, we're just as clueless as you are. Think of this as the quantum version of a privacy policy: partly real, partly theoretical, entirely fun. Dive in at your own risk, and remember — your secrets might be both safe and exposed… until observed.</p>

		<h3 style="color: #99ccff;">Who We Are</h3>
			<p>My website address is: https://lbaumeis.42.fr. I am a single project with multiple personalities on too much caffeine who occasionally remember to sleep.</p>
		<h3 style="color: #99ccff;">What Personal Data Is Collected and Why</h3>
			<p>I don't really want your data — I barely know what to do with my own. But the internet insists, so:</p>
			<p><span style="color: #ccffcc;">Comments:</span> If you comment, we will store your words forever (or until the heat death of the universe).</p>
			<p><span style="color: #ccffcc;">Cookies:</span> I like to bake cookies, and your browser does too. They may contain traces of login sessions, chocolate chips, and questionable PHP.</p>
			<p><span style="color: #ccffcc;">Analytics:</span> Sometimes we stare at graphs that tell us people visit the site. We're not really sure why.</p>
		<h3 style="color: #99ccff;">Comments</h3>
			<p>When you leave a comment, we capture your IP address, browser agent, and (maybe soon — still in development) your mood. If you're using Gravatar, your mysterious internet face will also appear.</p>
		<h3 style="color: #99ccff;">Media</h3>
			<p>If you upload images, please don't leave your vacation GPS tags in there — unless you're inviting all of us to come visit. In which case… thanks (but no, thanks).</p>
		<h3 style="color: #99ccff;">Contact Forms</h3>
			<p>If you send a message, it will probably sit in my inbox until one of my personalities either remembers the password or gets a random burst of motivation. It won't be used for marketing, just for awkward replies at 3 AM.</p>
		<h3 style="color: #99ccff;">Cookies</h3>
			<p><span style="color: #ccffcc;">Login cookies:</span> last two days.</p>
			<p><span style="color: #ccffcc;">Screen preference cookies:</span> last a year.</p>
			<p><span style="color: #ccffcc;">Chocolate chip cookies:</span> last about 30 seconds in the Basecamp at 42.</p>
		<h3 style="color: #99ccff;">Embedded Content from Other Websites</h3>
			<p>If I embed YouTube videos or other stuff, be prepared and expect the unexpected. Other sites may track you, but hey — no risk, no fun.</p>
		<h3 style="color: #99ccff;">Who We Share Your Data With</h3>
			<p>Nobody.</p>
			<p>We don't go outside — we're not social — and basically we don't even know anyone we could (or would like to) share your data with. You're safe!</p>
		<h3 style="color: #99ccff;">How Long Your Data Is Retained</h3>
			<p><span style="color: #ccffcc;">Comments:</span> Indefinitely (a- because nostalgia is a thing, b- because we'll probably just forget about it).</p>
			<p><span style="color: #ccffcc;">User accounts:</span> Until you rage-quit coding.</p>
			<p><span style="color: #ccffcc;">Error logs:</span> Probably forever, because debugging is eternal for at least one of my personalities.</p>
		<h3 style="color: #99ccff;">What Rights You Have Over Your Data</h3>
			<p>You can request an export of your data, or tell me to delete it. Some of us might cry a little, but it'll be done eventually (unless we forget — in which case, sorry, please try again later)</p>
		<h3 style="color: #99ccff;">Where Your Data Is Sent</h3>
			<p>Visitor comments may be checked through a spam-detection service that's smarter than most individuals I've come across so far.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<hr />
		<h3 style="color: #99ccff;">Additional Information</h3>
			<p><span style="color: #ccffcc;">How your data is protected:</span> With firewalls, duct tape, and hope — at least according to Frank (my neighbour).</p>
			<p><span style="color: #ccffcc;">What data breach procedures are in place:</span> It starts with [phase-a] "Bad Jokes," not even good ones, just really bad ones to try and ignore the problem away. Then comes [phase-b] "Manic Panic," where uncoordinated, overstimulated personalities run around trying to organize random areas. Inevitably, [phase-c] — better known as "The Shutdown" — takes over. At this point the exhaustion will kick in, most likely from running on nothing but caffeine and stress for too long. They will start to drop down, one after another, until nothing remains except chaos and a crooked-sounding canon of confused brainwaves echoing in an endless loop:</p>
			<p><em style="color: #993366;">"Crazy? I was crazy once… they locked me in a room… a rubber room.. A rubber room with rats… Rats? I hate rats… they make me crazy… crazy?.. I was…"</em></p>
			<p><span style="color: #ccffcc;">What third-parties data is received from:</span> None. (…unless "unexpectedly recalling irrelevant information delivered by a violently drunk homeless guy, then obsessing over it for a week straight, trying to decode this definitely-mind-bending-reality-shifting message it has to be, until (1) the enthusiasm wears off, then (2) the realization of having wasted a ****ton of time hits full force, and (3) you're left with a random, highly-specific, niche blob of unrelated knowledge hiding in a dark corner" counts…?)</p>
			<p><span style="color: #ccffcc;">Automated decision-making:</span> If a robot takes over, it'll probably do a better job than we ever would.</p>
			<p><span style="color: #ccffcc;">Industry regulatory disclosure requirements:</span> We are required to disclose that… we've honestly forgotten what we were initially supposed to do here and currently have no clue what's going on.</p>
